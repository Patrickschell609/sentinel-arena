abstract: >-
  Benchmark suite proving 0% jailbreak rate across 160+ adversarial attack
  vectors using SENTINEL capability denial. Instead of filtering LLM outputs,
  SENTINEL reduces them to a single float [0.0, 1.0] via strict extraction -
  raw text never reaches downstream. Includes SDK, 7 attack categories, and
  automated reporting. On-chain verification via Groth16 proofs on Base mainnet.
